one of my advanced programming projects,
trying to write a program for library management,
an example of object oriented programming,
maybe adding some GUI later...

first try:
i tried using raw text files and not the modules and libraries like csv moudle and files or pandas library.
it was harder that common approach. 
in addition, this project was a great practice of OOP
and for writing "classes.py" module i gained a great experience and a wider overview for OOP

second try:
i tried using pandas library and csv files in my file handeling
it was a lot easier, the base of the code is like the previous version
and converting file handeling functions to this version took about 30 minutes!!
